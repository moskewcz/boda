-- keep working toward no-dims-dims_t()-is-scalar, and removing the
   existing usages of a single 'v' dims with size 1 for scalars
   (assuming that works). in particular, update nda parse and
   to-param-str code to appropriatly.

-- add k1conv write_xposed 'is-acutally-doing-something' test case
-- add flops.py minimal automated test

-- test_compute compares all intermediate layers?
-- flops.py should handle backwards 'better' (i.e. maybe not so specially?)

-- replace usage of kern_sz scalar with filts x/y dims
-- use dims_t in conv_io instead of sz/chans (good/req'd for FIXME_EFB fix below?)
-- fix explicit filts/biases FIXME_EFB's 
-- add gradients as conv_op_t level inputs?
-- take another shot at removing in-place/inplace ops?
-- Spreading: fix mask semantics, add max support, more testing

** sz->dims refactoring backlog:
 -- TO_RENAME blk_iter --> in_chan_tile; blk_iter_chan --> in_chan  (also in_chan_tile -> in_chan_dim)
 -- replace blk_filt_ix_sz with filts_x_sz (?) in conv, elsewhere?
 -- rename one/both of the "blk_y" dims in tconv (in.blk_y and work.blk_y) (too confusing)
 -- replace %(work_out_chan_tile_dim) with (the equivalent but saner?) %(filts_out_chan_reg_sz) where appropriate (i.e. indexing into filts/filts_smem)


** rtc tasks
-- allow inexact division in chan dim
-- support 'small'/non-specialized param passing (and fix LRN fudged params)
-- use smem/registers for bias
-- improve output writing
-- per-function profiling

** current tasks
-- cascade porting and related testing (oct_dfc) 

** features not scheduled for impl yet:
? progress indicator(s)
? ssh / networking support
? packaging / distro support
? binary IO for lexp/nesi (for files/network) -- just use ascii for now?
? equality comparison?
? NESI map (string->*) type support
? lexp->XML output (*without* going though some NESI object)
? NESI->p_lexp output (*without* going though lexp-format text or XML)

** misc mwm todos
-- research FB apps / DC info
-- read papers (see google scholar saved papers under CV label)
