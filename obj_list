# ignorable ... user beware.

# needed for a feature (i.e. it is present in the system
# include/library paths), one need not specify them here. in the
# limit, for system-wide header-only libraries, a dependency section
# may be empty. however, it will still function in order to disable
# particular object files from being built if desired.
