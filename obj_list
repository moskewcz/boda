# note: editing this file is similar to editing the makefile.  in
# particular (like after editing the makefile), after editing this
# file, currently built objects might differ or fail to build after a
# make clean. however, in many cases, this may be acceptable /
# ignorable ... user beware.

# adjust paths below as needed. note that if no special paths are
# needed for a feature (i.e. it is present in the system
# include/library paths), one need not specify them here. in the
# limit, for system-wide header-only libraries, a dependency section
# may be empty. however, it will still function in order to disable
# particular object files from being built if desired.

# list of object files to compile. at least the objects that are
# direct dependencies of the above sections should be marked by adding
# the dependency section name after the object file below. thus, if
# the dependency is disabled, the code should compile -- but perhaps
# not like. for some dependencies, we also mark all indirect
# dependencies (FIXME: handle better? more automated / more
# explicit?). thus, for some dependencies we can disable them and both
# compile and link a reduced-functionality executable. since most of
# the time a particular set of dependencies is enabled/disabled, and
# the the dependency tracking here is manual, it may go stale and need
# to be updated when trying to disable a particular dependency. note
# that some dependencies may not usefully be disable-able.
